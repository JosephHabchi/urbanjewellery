Overview
- This project was a recreation of a real project I started for my family business in 2022.
- The store was aiming on taking advantage of digital marketing so begun collecting data for analyses.
- Due to data protection the real data compiled could not be used so the work was recreated with randomised data points for 2024.
- The data generation I used can be found in this repository and executed with VSCode to generate unique figures.

Objectives
1. Analyse key sales and profit trends for future comparison.
2. Identify key customer segments and their purchasing behaviour
3. Evaluate product performance and profitability.
4. Develop strategy and targetting analytics for online campaign.

Findings at a glance (executive summary)
1. February and December see major spikes due to Valentines Day and Christmas.
2. 10AM and 12PM - 3PM show very low activity compared to peaks at opening and closing.
3. Bracelets, Chains and Necklaces account for majority of sales and should be prioritised in digital campaigns.
4. Discounts has a marginal affect on sale distribution.
   
Practical use cases implemented:
1. Slower months were targetted in online advertising to supplement sales throughout the year.
2. Christmas and Valentines themed marketing campaigns were extremely successful.
3. At slower hours staff took their brakes to allow busier times to be fully staffed.
4. Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays saw lower staff as they fell below the average daily sales.
5. Chains and Bracelets were top sellers but also sold majority of their sales during discounts, this lead to more frequent promotions on other slower selling jewellery and advertising focusing on Chain and Bracelet sales.
   
Product Analysis:

Findings at a glance (product analysis)
1. Although selling nearly 50x more than 24K Gold, Silver had similar revenue figures to 24K Gold.
2. Top selling products were Silver chains, Silver bracelets, 24K gold chains and bracelets.

Practical use case:
1. The top selling products were bought in higher quantities for the following calendar year.
2. Silver was used less in campaigns as Gold provided more total revenue with less sales, this eased logistics and meant that less shipping and fulfillment could still give equal profit.
3. 9K Gold was stocked a lot less due to poor sales numbers.
4. 22K and 24K Bracelets and chains were ordered in larger quantites as they contributed the majority of sales.

Customer Insights:![Customer Analytics](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db4a93fe-f10c-43c1-8584-3987d6cc955b)
Findings at a glance (customer insights)
1. 35-44 age group were responsible for majority of the sales.
2. 55-65+ generated less revenue but would spend more on individual products.
3. Females were the top spenders for the year
4. Cash was the preffered payment method.
   
Practical use case:
1. The age range of 35-44 was primarily targetted for advertising due to contributing the majority of sales.
2. 55-65+ were targetted for higher value sales as they show more willing to spend large on a single purchase
3. Females were targetted during campaigns as they contributed majority of revenue.
   
Project Limitations
- By generating my data I saw that the unpredictability of purchasing intent was not presented well in the data files, this led to a lot of data being very similar accross months and jewellery.
- The amount of Non-Binary and Prefer Not To Say was far too large of a % of sales in comparison to the real dataset
- Profit margins were slightly exagerated compared to real life scenario.
